# project_brief.md

## Problem and objectives
- Describe the overall project goals.
- What is the problem the project aiming to to solve and why we want to solve it?
- What result we want to see in the end of the project?


# scope_context.md
- A project is composed by one or more scopes.
- Scopes are integrated "slices" of work. Think of it like phases with very integrated pieces of work. They reflect meaningful parts of the problem that can be completed **independently** or very little dependence on other project scopes. Ideally they integrate frontend and backend.
- This section explains in more detail the scope under development on the project right now.


## Scope objective
- What is the scope under development on the project right now?
- This is the actual piece or "slice" of work being built
- What are desired user flows or key solution outputs?

## Key elements
- What are the key solution elements that define the current scope?
- What are the must have for the solution given scope?

## Out of scope and No-Gos
- Situations, edge cases, or any technical implementation we're chosing not to build in the current scope

# system_pattern.md
- This section documents what are the overall design patterns in the project
- What is the project architecture? What the architectural choices that build the logic required in the project?

# tech_constraints.md
- This section documents stack choices in the project
- What tecnical solutions we must use to meet the project and scope objectives?

# active_context.md
- A scope is composed by value delivery tasks - VDT.
- VDT are required pieces of work to complete a given scope.
- This section documents what are the needed VDT needed to complete a given scope
- Use the format below to document completed and pending value delivery tasks <br> <br>
[ ] Value Delivery task to be done <br>
[x] Value Delivery task Done


# progress.md
- Document what are the required scopes to complete the overall project and not only the current scope specified in the scope objective section.
- This section is documented at scope level and not task level.
- Follow the placeholders below to document the overall progress
- This section is updated as we move forward in the project. We might split a given scope into new scopes, discard a given scope etc.

## Completed
- Scope 1
- Scope 2

## To be done
- Scope 3
- Scope 4
