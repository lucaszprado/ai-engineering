# project_brief.md
- Describe the overall project goals.

## Problem 
- What is the problem the project aiming to to solve and why we want to solve it?

## Objectives
- What result we want to see in the end of the project?

## Organization
Some project have very clear boundaries since the begining.
When it's case we use this section to explain give an overview of projec phases.
In general phases are a feature, a user story, a subsystem.
On this Heading we list the project phases:

- Phase 1
- Phase 2
- Phase N
  
## Phase N: Phase name
Each phase is described at a high level on this section.
In general phases are a feature, a user story, a subsystem. Our user stories pages can be used to describe the phase.

### Objective
Which are the phase objetives?

### Key elements
- What are the desired user flows or key solution outputs?

### Out of Scope, No Gos and Open Questions
- Situations, edge cases, or any technical implementation we're chosing not to build in the current scope

# scope_context.md
- A project is composed by one or more scopes.
- Scopes are integrated "slices" of work. Think of it like phases with very integrated pieces of work. They reflect meaningful parts of the problem that can be completed **independently** or with very little dependence on other project scopes. Ideally they integrate frontend and backend.
- Each scope delivers a clear and testable increment, they easy code review process by avoiding context switching and keeping code changes under a trackable amount of files (less than 10 files ideally).
- This section explains in more detail the scope under development on the project right now.

## Scope Name
- What is the scope under development on the project right now?

## Scope objective
- This is the actual piece or "slice" of work being built.
- High level objetive phrase descrbing what needs to be done.

## Scope Description
- Why this scope is needed
- How does it connect to others scopes delivered and to be done?

## Key elements
- What are the key solution elements that define the current scope?
- What are the must have for the solution given scope?

## Out of scope and No-Gos
- Situations, edge cases, or any technical implementation we're chosing not to build in the current scope

# system_pattern.md
- This section documents what are the overall **design patterns in the project**
- What is the project architecture? What the architectural choices that build the logic required in the project?

# tech_constraints.md
- This section documents **stack choices in the project**
- What tecnical solutions we must use to meet the project and scope objectives?

# active_context.md
- A scope is composed by value delivery tasks - VDT.
- VDT are required pieces of work to complete a given scope.
- This section documents what are the needed VDT needed to complete a given scope and any relevant detail to be considered to build the VDTs

## VDTs
- Use the format below to document completed and pending value delivery tasks <br> <br>
[ ] Value Delivery task to be done <br>
[x] Value Delivery task Done

## Important notes regarding the building phase or implementation of this scope

### Issue N

# progress.md
- Document what are the required scopes to complete the overall project and not only the current scope specified in the scope objective section.
- This section is documented at scope level and not task level.
- Follow the placeholders below to document the overall progress
- This section is updated as we move forward in the project. We might split a given scope into new scopes, discard a given scope etc.
- If project has more than one phase, we group scopes under each phase

## Phase N
### Completed
- Scope 1
- Scope 2

### Under Development

### To be done
- Scope 3
- Scope 4
