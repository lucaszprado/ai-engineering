# Scaffold: scope_context.md

## Purpose
A project is composed by one or more scopes.
This section explains in more detail the scope under development on the project right now.

## Required structure

```md
# Scope Context

## Scope Name
- What is the scope under development on the project right now?
- Short, unique identifier for the current scope (e.g., "WhatsApp Intake")

## Scope objective
- Actual piece or "slice" of work being built.
- One sentence describing the expected outcome (clear and verifiable).

## Scope Description
- Why this scope exists (problem or gap it addresses)
- How it connects to previously delivered scopes
- How it enables or unblocks future scopes

## Key elements
- Core components, flows, or artifacts that must exist
- Critical constraints or decisions shaping the solution

## Out of scope and No-Gos
- Explicitly excluded features, edge cases, or approaches
- Known trade-offs or postponed decisions
```

## Example
The following is an example of how a `scope_context.md` file may look.

```md
# Scope Context

## Scope Name
- WhatsApp PDF Intake v1

## Scope Objective
- Enable users to upload PDF medical reports via WhatsApp and persist them as Source records in the system

## Scope Description
- Users currently cannot easily ingest medical documents into the platform
- This scope introduces a simple ingestion channel using WhatsApp, building on the existing Source model
- It will serve as the foundation for future scopes involving OCR extraction and structured data parsing

## Key Elements
- WhatsApp webhook endpoint to receive user messages
- Media retrieval logic (download PDF from provider)
- Source record creation with attached file (ActiveStorage / S3)
- Basic validation (file type, size)
- Logging and error handling for failed downloads

## Out of Scope and No-Gos
- No OCR or data extraction from the PDF
- No classification of document type (e.g., blood test vs imaging)
- No retry queue or background job system (synchronous processing only)
- No user-facing UI for uploads (WhatsApp only)
```


# Scaffold: system_patterns.md

## Purpose
This document summarizes architectural patterns and design decisions used across the project:
- i) Key patterns used in the repo
- ii) Pre-selected patterns to be used in project (mapped when making the discovery about the project)
- iii) Key pattern decisions made in the course or the project.

These patterns should guide consistent implementation across scopes.

## Current Patterns
- Architectural patterns used in this repo that are relevant to the current project

## Pre-selected patterns
- Along the projet we might need to make pattern decisions to develiver the features and behaviors we want.
- This section lists which patterns were already overviewed for each of the features the project implements and why we considered them a good option. If you have another alternative and consider it better, please advise.
- If no pattern was analysed in advance, this section is blank.

## Changes to the existing patterns

###  <Pattern name>
- <...> are placeholders for this header
- Short, descriptive name for the pattern (e.g., "Source as Polymorphic Ingestion Layer")

#### Key Context
- What problem or constraint led to this pattern?
- When should this pattern be applied?
- Make a briefly description.

#### Alternatives Considered

# System Patterns

## Current Patterns

## Pre-selected patterns

## Changes to the existing patterns

### Source as Polymorphic Ingestion Layer

#### Context
- The system needs to ingest multiple types of health data (blood exams, imaging reports, prescriptions, etc.)
- Each data type has different structures but shares a common ingestion and storage flow
- The system must remain flexible to support new data types in the future

#### Alternatives Considered
- Polymorphic association

#### Decision
- Use a polymorphic `Source` model as the central ingestion layer
- Each domain entity (e.g., ImagingDiagnostic, BloodExam, Prescription) is associated with one or more Sources
- This allows all ingestion flows (upload, API, WhatsApp) to be standardized

#### Implementation Shape
- `Source` model with `source_type` and polymorphic association (`sourceable`)
- `Source` has attachments via ActiveStorage (`files`)
- Domain models (e.g., ImagingDiagnostic) `has_many :sources`
- Ingestion pipelines always create a Source first, then associate downstream data
- Controllers and services operate primarily through Source

#### Trade-offs
- Adds indirection when querying domain-specific data
- Requires careful handling of polymorphic associations in queries
- Some validations must be conditional based on source type

#### Pattern Key Words
- polymorphism
- ingestion-layer
- abstraction

```

# Scaffold: tech_context.md

## Purpose
This document summarizes:
- i) Key technologies used in the repo
- ii) Pre-selected technologies to be used in project (mapped when making the discovery about the project)
- iii) Key technological decisions made in the course or the project.

When a new technological decision is made, we register:
- the context of the decision: what were the requirements?
- the selected technology and other (if any) alternatives considered
- what decision we made and why
- how the decision is used or presented in the system

This helps maintain consistency and supports future migrations or refactors.

## Changes to the current stack

### ActiveStorage with S3 for File Storage

#### Context
- The system needs to store and serve user-uploaded medical files (PDFs, images, DICOM)
- Files can be large and must be reliably accessible and scalable
- Local storage is not suitable for production environments

#### Alternatives Considered
- ActiveStorage with S3
- Local disk storage (rejected due to lack of scalability)
- Direct S3 SDK usage (rejected due to higher complexity)
- Third-party services (e.g., Cloudinary) (rejected to maintain control and reduce costs)

#### Decision
- Use Rails ActiveStorage with AWS S3 as the storage backend
- Chosen due to tight Rails integration, ease of use, and native support for cloud storage
- Avoided custom upload pipelines to reduce complexity and speed up development
- Local disk storage: rejected due to lack of scalability
- Direct S3 SDK usage: rejected due to higher complexity
- Third-party services: (e.g., Cloudinary) rejected to maintain control and reduce costs

#### Implementation Shape
- Backend: Rails (ActiveStorage)
- Infrastructure: AWS S3 bucket for file storage
- `Source` model uses `has_many_attached :files`
- Files are uploaded via controllers and stored directly in S3
- URLs are generated through ActiveStorage (signed URLs when needed)
- Environment-specific configuration in `storage.yml`
- Used alongside WebP processing pipeline for images

#### Trade-offs
- Limited control compared to a fully custom file handling system
- Performance depends on S3 latency
- Requires additional configuration for secure access (signed URLs, permissions)

#### Decision Key Words
- Storage
- Scalability

```


# Scaffold: active_context.md

## Purpose
This document tracks the execution state of the current scope through Value Delivery Tasks (VDTs).
VDTs represent small, concrete units of work that directly contribute to delivering value within the scope.
This file should reflect:
- what is done
- what is in progress or pending
- important implementation considerations specific to this scope

## Required Structure
**Value Delivery Task Status Legend**
[ ] VDT to be done <br>
[/] VDT in progress <br>
[x] VDT Completed <br>
[o] VDT Aborted / archived / merged

```md
# Active Context

## VDTs
Use the checklist format below to track progress.
Guidelines:
- Each VDT should be a small unit of value
- Prefer outcome-oriented descriptions (not just actions)
- Order tasks by execution priority

[ ] VDT Name – short description
[/] VDT Name – short description
[x] VDT Name – short description
[o] VDT Name – short description


## Implementation Notes
Relavant key constraints, patterns, and considerations specific to this scope not mentioned at the project level in the `tech_context.md` or `system_pattern.md` files. Only include them if relevant to shape the proposed solution among the probable possible solutions.

Typical Notes:
- System patterns to follow
- Dependencies (internal or external)
- Technical constraints or decisions
- References to other documentation


### Issue <N> : <Issue Name>
<...> are placeholders for this header
- Description: What is the issue?
- Impact: Why does it matter for this scope?
- Guidance: How should it be handled?

```

## Example
The following is an example of how a `active_context.md` file may look.

```md
# Active Context

## VDTs
[x] Create WhatsApp webhook endpoint
